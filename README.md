# Nordic nrf8001 BLE example for STM32F4

An example showing the ble-sdk-arduino library for the Nordic nrf8001 device family ported to the ST STM32F407/discovery kit.  A UART RX interrupt buffers the characters entered beforing sending a 20 byte notification packet.

The porting effort is described in a [blog entry](http://shrakeblogshere.blogspot.com/2016/04/nordic-nrf8001-library-for-st-stm32f4xx.html) I posted.
